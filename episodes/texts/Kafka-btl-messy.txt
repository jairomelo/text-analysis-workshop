Before the Law stands a doorkeeper. To this doorkeeper there comes a
countryman and prays for adminance to the Law. But the doorkeeper
says that he cannot grant adminance at the moment. The man thinks it
over and then asks if he will be allowed in later. "his possible," says the
doorkeeper, "but not at the moment." Since the gate stands open, as
usual, and the doorkeeper steps to one side, the man stoops to peer
through the gateway into the interior. Observing that, the doorkeeper
laughs and says: "If you are so drawn to it, ju:-.t try to go in despite my
veto. But take note: I am powerful. And I am only the least of rhe
doorkeepers. from hall to hall there is one doorkeeper after another, each
more powerful th.in the last. The third doorkeeper is already so terrible
that even I cannot bear to look at him." These are difficulties the countryman
has not expected; the Law, he thinks, should surely be accessible at
all times and to everyone, but as he now rakes a closer look at the
doorkeeper in his fur coat, with his big sharp nose and long, thin, black
Tartar beard, he decides that it is better to wait until he gets permission
to enter. The doorkeeper gives him a stool and lets him sit down at one
side of the door. There he sits for days and years. He makes many attempts
to he admitted, and wearies the doorkeeper by his importunity. The
doorkeeper frequently has lin!e interviews v>"ith him, asking him que,tions
abom his home and many other things, but the questions arc put indifferently,
as great lords put them, and always finish with the statement that
he cannot be let in yet. The man, who has furnished himself with many
things for his journey, sacrifices all he has, however valuahle, to bribe the
doorkeeper. Thar official accepts everything, but always with the remark:
"I am only taking it to keep you from thinking you have omitted anything."
During these many years the man fixes his attention almost continuously
on the doorkeeper. He forgets the other doorkeepers, and this first
one seems to him the sole obstacle preventing access to the Law. He curses
his had luck, in his early years boldly and loudly, later, as he grows old,
he only grumbles to himself. He becomes childish, and since in his yearslong
contemplation of the doorkeeper he has come to know even the fleas
in his fur collar, he begs the fleas as well to help him and to change the
doorkeeper's mind. At length his eyesight begins to fail, and he does not
know whether the world is really darker or whether his eyes are only
deceiving him. Yet in his darkness he is now awart: of a radiance that
streams inextmguish;ibly from the gateway of the Law. Now he has not
very long to live. Before he dies, all his experiences in these long years
gather themselves in his head to one point, a question he has not yet asked
the doorkeeper. He waves him nearer, since he can no longer raise his
stiffening body. The doorkeeper has to bend low towards him, for the
difference in height between them has altered much to the countryman's
disadvantage. "What do you want to know now?" asks the doorkeeper.
"You are insatiahle." "Everyone strives to reach the Law," says the man,
"so how docs it happen that for all these many years no one but myself
has ever begged for admittance?" The doorkeeper recognizes that the
man has reached his end, and to let his failing senses catch the words
roars in his ear: "No one else could ever be admitted here, since this gate
was made only for you. I am now going to shut it."'
